We care about New York. 212-686-1001,” reads the text popping up in the final frames of the mysterious PSA, as the music goes from mystifying to straight up scary —\\xa0sounding not unlike the Angelo Badalamenti-composed score to some of “Twin Peaks”‘ most terrifying moments.\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nA mother tosses an ice pop wrapper in Central Park in the resurfaced clip from the late “Mulholland Drive” director.

NYC Sanitation\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nThe simple, final message is revealed on screen as the scary movie music soundtrack crescendos.  NYC Sanitation\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nLynch filmed the spot back in the early 1990s, when the TV show “Twin Peaks” became one of the most talked-about series in the country.  REUTERS\\nThe listed number was a complaint hotline of sorts —\\xa0something like a predecessor to the modern-day 311. Currently, it is listed as belonging to a hair and beauty supply shop in the Flatiron District. \\n“In 1991, David Lynch showed the world the alienation and innate horror of a dirty street, directing this unforgettable anti-littering ad for the City of New York,” a rep wrote on the NYC Sanitation X account.\\n“RIP to a visionary filmmaker and a pioneer of the Trash Revolution,” they continued. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Leave it to Lynch to make an ad feel like reading Camus,” one viewer commented.\\nAccording to a 2017 post at Gothamist, the trashy tape was filmed as part of a series known as “We Care About New York,” during one of the Big Apple’s most rotten eras.\\n\\nThe miniature masterpiece was a collaboration between Lynch and his long-time director of photography, Frederick Elmes.\\nThe “Mullholland Drive” director also notably filmed commercial spots for Calvin Klein, Armani and others throughout his lengthy and storied career.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nFiled

The club received $6.91 million in bonus pool money this year.\\nInternational signing coverage:• Everything you need to know• Top 50 Prospects list• Each team's top international prospect• Latest news on Roki Sasaki\\nThe financial commitment to De Los Santos ranks among the highest that the organization has ever offered an international talent, and for good reason. The left-handed-hitting native of the Dominican Republic is highly regarded for his on-field instincts and passion for the game. One of the youngest members of this year’s international class, De Los Santos comes from a baseball family and trains with the highly regarded Jaime Ramos, a member of MLB’s Trainer Partnership Program.\\nDe Los Santos deploys a line drive-based approach, although his physique and twitchy actions leave the door open for some power to come into his game as he matures. He sees the majority of his game reps at shortstop, where he has solid actions and an above-average throwing arm. The tools are there for him to impact the game on the basepaths as well, with a plus run grade elevating his all-around ceiling.\\nThe Pirates have also signed Darell Morel, another Dominican shortstop, who landed a $1,778,600 bonus. At 6-foot-5, Morel boasts a powerful left-handed swing that allows him to tap into his extra-base pop with regularity. The organization has shown that its not afraid to keep taller players at the six, with 6-foot-7 Oneil Cruz sticking at the spot full-time during his ascent through Pittsburgh’s Minor League system.\\nThe Bucs also added Armstrong Muhoozi, an infielder from Uganda, for $40,000. Muhoozi is the second Ugandan player in the past three years to sign with Pittsburgh and just the fifth ever to sign with a Major League team (the Dodgers have signed three since 2022). Right-hander David Matoma, whom the Pirates signed in 2023, has posted a 0.47 ERA over 38 2/3 frames in the Minors.\\nWhile Pittsburgh lacks a true impact international talent at the upper levels of the Minors presently, the potential for one to emerge remains immense: their top 12 prospects were all Draft picks, but spots 13-30 include 10 players from the international market.\\n\\n Get Pirates tickets for the 2025 season\\n\\nBeyond the wealth of pitching talent currently in the Pirates’ pipeline, shortstop is the organization’s most robust position in terms of future impact. In the lower levels alone, the club boasts Konnor Griffin (PIT No. 2/MLB No. 50), Mitch Jebb (PIT No. 9), Wyatt Sanford (PIT No. 10), Yordany De Los Santos (Johan's older brother and PIT No. 13) and Keiner Delgado (PIT No. 23) as potential long-term options at the six.\\nBut shortstop is the position often held down by talented youngsters coming up the amateur ranks; in theory, if you can play there, you can play anywhere. Having a multitude of options is a luxury for any franchise, let alone one that determined last season that Cruz would go from full-time shortstop to full-time outfielder.\\nPaths to the big leagues are often long -- Cruz’s journey before becoming a full-time contributor for the Bucs was six years in the Minors in his own right. Johan De Los Santos, who will be 16 years old for most of the upcoming season, offers his own excitement ahead of his pro debut this summer, while Morel has already shown the flashes of impact potential that the club covets.\\nAn international player is eligible to sign with a Major League team between Jan. 15 and Dec. 15. He must turn 16 before he signs and be 17 before Sept. 1 the following year.\\nThat means players born between Sept. 1, 2007, and Aug. 31, 2008, will be eligible to sign in the current signing period. Players must be registered with Major League Baseball in advance to be eligible to sign.\\nAdditional notable Pirates signees and their signing bonuses:\\nGabriel Rodriguez, OF (Venezuela) -- $900,000Robinson Smith, RHP (Australia) -- $400,000Yoslaniel Hernandez, LHP (Cuba) -- $400,000\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"},\n",

In fact, you’ve spotted one of the world’s most bizarre architectural phenomena.\\nSantos is an interesting contradiction—it’s a sunny coastal city with pristine beaches that also plays host to a bustling port. What draws the eye, however, is the skyline—it’s decidedly askew. This isn’t a Photoshop job or some avant-garde urban planning experiment, either. It’s a consequence of engineering hubris, poor planning, and geology just doing its thing.\\n\\nSide to Side\\nIt’s easy to spot the lean on the buildings in Santos. Credit: janhamlet, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\\nThe Leaning Tower of Pisa is celebrated for being a building that somehow tilted over without collapsing. In Santos, though, that sort of thing barely raises an eyebrow. The city is dotted all over with buildings on the tilt. From 2004 to 2012, all 651 beachfront buildings were measured, and all were off-kilter to some degree. Some are just barely leaning over, maybe a couple of inches out of level. A more extreme example, like the Excelsior, measures 1.8 meters out of level. It’s a severe tilt that you can spot at an instant.\\nSantos didn’t set out to create its very own gallery of modern Leaning Towers. Most of the city’s lopsided skyscrapers were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, during a period when Brazil’s building codes were more permissive.\\nIt’s not just one building, either, it’s around 100 or so. Credit: janhamlet, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\\nDevelopers eager to cash in slapped together high-rise buildings with foundations only a few meters deep. This is perfectly valid when construction takes place directly on solid bedrock, but Santos sadly lacks such a convenient base. The ground is instead a bed of sand, seven meters deep, which sits upon a deeper bed of clay. Constructing the buildings with deep foundations down to the bedrock below would have avoided this problem, albeit at some expense. Instead, developers just pushed forward with the cheaper option.\\nFast forward a few decades, and the problems are obvious. Over time, the towers weight tended to push out water from the clay below, leading to the buildings sinking somewhat, and often quite unevenly. The result is a skyline that looks like it’s leaning with the wind, with around 100 buildings visibly off-kilter to the naked eye. It’s a unique sight—and a rare one at that. Where else will you see modern skyscrapers looking like they’re about to fall right over?\\nThe geology of Santos, combined with engineering decisions, lead to the problem. Credit: “Innovative techniques…”\\nDespite the lean, many of these buildings are still in use, most of them as residential housing. The buildings are regularly inspected and maintained, a sage decision given the ominous angles of lean. So far, there haven’t been any major catastrophies, so much as minor inconveniences. Problems with stuck doors and windows are common, and in many cases there’s an easily-detectable lean when walking around inside. Some owners choose to compensate by levelling their floor, though it’s usually still obvious there’s a problem whenever looking at the walls.\\nOver the years, there’s been talk of fixing the leaning buildings. Engineers have explored various means of jacking them back upright. Sadly, the cost of leveling even a single building is astronomical, and so far, only two have been corrected. Getting the buildings back into plumb involved huge hydraulic jacks, and the construction of new subfoundations able to properly support the building without further subsidence.\\xa0 This cost was, at the very least, offset to some degree by the fact the value of the apartments in the buildings rose significantly after correction. Still, for the rest of the buildings in Santos, though, it’s pretty much lean or bust.\\n          These two towers were the subject of extensive works to return them to plumb.were             Tower A was restored first, receiving a whole new foundation.          Tower B was fixed some years later.       \\nIt’s perhaps odd that Santos hasn’t become a global tourist trap like Pisa. Perhaps the answer lies in the scale of the leaning problem. Pisa’s single iconic tower is a historical oddity, a relic of medieval miscalculation. Santos’ slanting skyline, on the other hand, is a modern engineering mistake that doesn’t have the same romantic aura.\\xa0 Nor are the leaning building suitable as a tourist attraction, given the residents wouldn’t appreciate the intrusion of visitors marvelling at their wonky stairwells. Still, if you’re in the neighborhood, it’s worth a look. The beachfront is lined with these leaning giants, creating a surreal backdrop that’s equal parts charming and unsettling.\\nFor now, Santos’ leaning towers stand as a cautionary tale. Cutting corners in construction can leave a lasting mark—sometimes a very obvious one. Next time you’re marveling at a city’s skyline, spare a thought for the ground beneath it. You never know what secrets it’s hiding—or how much it’s shifting underfoot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPosted in Engineering, Featured, Interest, Original Art, SliderTagged brazil, building, engineering, santos \\n\\n\\nPost navigation\\n\\n←\\xa0It’s A Doughnut, In HardwareProcedurally Generated Terrain In OpenSCAD\\xa0→ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            48 thoughts on “The Many Leaning Towers Of Santos, Brazil”        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPaul McGuinness says: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJanuary 14, 2025 at 8:04 am\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot just Pisa… there are leaning towers in other Italian cities like Venice, Bologna and Rome.\\n\\n\\nReport comment \\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlake HANNAFORD says: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJanuary 14, 2025 at 12:29 pm\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPisa has more than one leaning tower.

Be it wildfires or hurricanes, everything was great until it wasnt. You played the odds that the worst wouldnt happen and in the end your fate was decided by mother nature and a crazed arsonist or errant electric component. Whats happening to the towers is inevitable and avoidable by anyone with common sense. Where youre right is that its still random chance how quickly the demise occurs.\\nOn another note, The Palisades was one of the most beautiful places to live on earth, with a luxurious climate. You can see it in the emotions of those reacting to the loss of their homes.

Every nation faces its own dilemmas, and often the solutions require more than just a simple change in policy or financial investment. The quest for a world free of structural failures or risks in different social spheres seems to be a universal and complex task. What we need to understand is that difficulties and structural flaws exist in every corner of the planet, and the key to a safer, more balanced future is to work together to find solutions, recognize our vulnerabilities, and learn from the mistakes of the past.\\n\\n\\nReport comment \\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDavid says: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJanuary 16, 2025 at 3:12 am\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis comment reads like AI\\nAlso as a Santos local I can tell you this only really exists here.\\n\\n\\nReport comment \\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a ReplyCancel reply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

Flowers\\n\\n\\nJan 14, 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJan 14, 2025\\n\\n\\n\\nChicago Bears\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe nightmare that was the 2024 Chicago Bears season is over. Before the transactional period starts and the roster changes begin, we will recap the seasons of most of the 53-man roster. Today, we’re looking at the 2024 season of kicker Cairo Santos.\\n\\n\\n\\nCairo Santos’ 2024 Snapshot\\n\\nWhat a roller coaster ride this season was for Cairo Santos. He experienced the highs of drilling a game-winning kick against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field and the lows of having his would-be game-winning kick blocked by the Packers at Soldier Field in November.\\nSantos said after the former that he prayed on receiving the opportunity to redeem his blocked kick against the Packers. As fate would have it, his prayers were answered, and he did not miss his shot at redemption. But was it enough to earn the confidence of the Bears front office moving forward?\\nSantos’ leg strength and distance were topics of conversation for much of the season. This was amplified when the Packers publicly admitted they felt they could block his kick at a specific range because of the trajectory Santos needed to get it off from that distance. \\n\\n\\n“On film, on his past games, we seen him how he was kicking it low, so we knew we had a good chance [of blocking].” Packers rookie linebacker Edgerrin Cooper said after the November 17 game at Soldier Field (via Kalyn Kahler). “We’ve been emphasizing it so much this week. Coach Rich, he even said he’ll be upset if we ain’t get one.”\\n\\n© Daniel Bartel-Imagn Images\\n\\nEarly in Santos’ career, he struggled mightily with converting field goal attempts over 50 yards. After a three-year run in Kansas City, where he served as the team’s starting kicker, his distance woes left him bouncing around the league for the next three years, making stops in Chicago, Los Angeles, Tampa Bay, and Tennessee before returning to Chicago as the Bears contingency plan for Eddie Piñeiro, who they had lost confidence in.\\nSince taking over for Piñeiro full-time in 2020, he’s been much better, making 21 of 27 from 50+ yards and 39 of 48 in the 40-49 yard range. Santos hasn’t missed a field goal from under 40 yards in his five seasons as the Bears full-time kicker, making his last 73 kicks from less than 40 yards.\\n\\n\\nBy the Numbers\\n\\nField Goals: 21-25\\nField Goal %: 84.0\\nField Goal 20-29: 4-4 (100%)\\nField Goal 30-39: 4-4 (100%)\\nField Goal 40-49: 5-8 (62.5%)\\nField Goal 50+: 8-9 (88.8%)\\nField Goal Long: 54\\nExtra Points: 25-26\\n\\n\\nContract Status \\nSantos signed a four-year, $15.6 million contract extension with the Bears in December 2023. In 2025, he is scheduled to make $3.1 million in base salary, $1.06 million in signing bonuses, and $100 thousand in workout bonuses. His total cap number for 2025 is $4.26 million. \\nIf the Bears decided to move on from Santos as a pre-June 1 cut designation, they would incur $2.18 million in dead cap money and save $2.64 million. If the Bears wanted to give Santos one more bite at the apple, it would be cheaper to cut him next offseason; at this point, they would incur a $1.12 million dead cap hit and receive $2.64 million in cap savings. \\n\\n\\nOne Big Question for 2025\\nIs Cairo Santos’ leg strong enough? \\nSantos’ percentage on kicks north of 50 yards was good in 2024, but the Bears know his limitations. His long was 54 yards, and his career-long is 55 yards. The Bears didn’t send him out for kicks that would have been outside that range multiple times, whereas kicks from 55+ yards have become commonplace around the NFL. \\n\\n© Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\\n\\nDallas’ Brandon Aubrey nailed a 65-yard field goal this season and was 2-4 on kicks longer than 60 yards. Joey Slye and Tyler Bass have makes from north of 60 this season, and 21 other kickers have season-long field goals of 56 yards or longer. \\nSantos was blocked three times this season, the most in the league. This is another sign that his trajectory when attempting deep kicks is too low in an attempt to compensate for having a lesser leg than most NFL kickers. \\n\\n\\nIs Santos’ limitations from distance a significant concern for the Bears this offseason? It’s probably not at the top of the list for Ryan Poles and this front office. Hiring a head coach, an entire staff of assistants, and multiple starting roles on the offensive and defensive lines are bigger priorities to fill in the next few months. Taking a kicker in the draft is probably not happening after they spent a fourth-rounder on a punter last April. It would come via free agency or the undrafted free agent route if they were to replace Santos.\\nBut my hunch is they’ll run it back with Santos and make a move following the 2025 season when it’s more financially prudent for them to do so. But if they don’t, here is a list of potential options:\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nShow comments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSHOW COMMENTS!\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead More\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCunningham and the Titans, Frazier and the Cowboys, New Analytics Director Needed, and Other Bears Bullets\\n\\n\\nHere is an Explanation For Why It’s Taking So Long For the Bears to Hire a Coach\\n\\n\\nThe 2024 Chicago Bears Offensive Line Grades Are Out —\\xa0And They’re Not Pretty\\n\\n\\nWhy Are the Bears So Hot For Mike McCarthy?\\n\\n\\nCaleb Williams Outlines EXACTLY What He Wants in the New Bears Head Coach\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwritten by\\n\\n              Patrick K.

(Supplied)DEMIRS prosecutor Jeremy Johnston said the section of the pipeline was nearing the end of its life and was close to five years old at the time.He said Santos failed to properly investigate the pipeline for any potential damage and that punishment was needed to deter other companies from similar negligence.Santos gave the court an endorsed guilty plea prior to Monday\\'s appearance and agreed the company had failed to adequately ensure the pipeline was safe for use.Gas giant Santos accused of cover-up over oil spill, dolphin deaths off WA coastPhoto shows A dolphin floating belly up on top of the ocean surface. A former Santos employee accuses\\xa0the oil and gas company of covering up the severity of an oil spill he alleges killed dolphins off WA\\'s coast.Santos\\'s lawyer Liam Nicholls told the court that the company had conducted its own internal investigation, commissioned an independent inquiry and continued to work directly with the regulator.He said the working life spans of pipelines were also amended, reducing them to three years, instead of five.Mr Nicholls told the court Santos \"takes its statutory obligations seriously\" and expressed remorse on behalf of the company.In his decision, Magistrate Young said any punishment needed to reflect the seriousness of the allegations.\"There can be no message conveyed that it is more effective to absorb fines as the cost of doing business,\" he said.However, he said the actions taken by Santos had given \"serious attention\" to the infringement and had set up a \"robust set of safeguards\".Magistrate Young noted that \\xa0\"no allegation of environmental damage\" was brought to the court\\'s attention and said the spill was \"relatively limited\".A dead dolphin allegedly found in the ocean after the oil spill. (Supplied: Parliament of Australia)\\'Limited\\' environmental impactLawyers for both the state and Santos told the court there was no serious environmental impact because of the spill.Mr Nicholls said aerial and water surveys revealed 95 per cent of the condensate evaporated within 24 hours of the spill and the remainder evaporated over the next few days.Whistleblower testimony tabled in federal parliament in early 2023 claimed the spill caused the deaths of dolphins and other marine life.The testimony, tabled by independent Senator David Pocock, also claimed Santos had covered up the impact of the spill.Santos has continually denied the claims and a report at the time found the environmental impact to be \"negligible\".In a statement provided to the ABC, a Santos spokesperson said the company \"deeply regrets the spill\" and that previous surveys on the line revealed \"no damage or deterioration\".The spokesperson confirmed the line had been \"maintained in accordance with the prescribed service life of the line\".DEMIRS resource and environmental compliance executive director Tyler Sujdovic said enforcing compliance was a key priority of the department.\"Operating subsea pipelines in a \\'proper and workmanlike manner\\' is a fundamental principle widely understood and applied by operators in the oil and gas industry,\" he said.\"Companies must ensure all workers, including contractors, have the required training and access to up-to-date written procedures to manage petroleum effectively.\"Mr Sudjovic said the department would continue to ensure petroleum activities were undertaken in a safe way.Fine \\'completely inadequate\\'The Conservation Council of WA has labelled the fine as \"inadequate\" and warned it would do little to prevent further cases.The council\\'s fossil fuels programs manager Anna Champan said the costs would not be \"enough to deter oil spill\".\"That\\'s less than 40 cents per litre of oil spilled,\" she said.\"So the fine is completely inadequate.\"Find more local newsBrowse for your location and find more local ABC News and informationPosted\\xa0Mon 6 Jan 2025 at 6:38amMonday 6 Jan 2025 at 6:38amMon 6 Jan 2025 at 6:38am, updated\\xa0Tue 7 Jan 2025 at 1:13amTuesday 7 Jan 2025 at 1:13amTue 7 Jan 2025 at 1:13amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX\\xa0(formerly\\xa0Twitter)Top StoriesCeasefire back on track as Israel says it\\'s reached deal with HamasLIVEPhoto shows picture of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\\'We will hunt you down\\': Police vow to find those behind racist attackTopic:VandalismPhoto shows Silver Mercedes Benz vandalised with an antisemitic message in the early hours of the morning\\'Brutal\\' Australian Open fans under fire again after Collins\\'s post-match anticsLIVEPhoto shows Tennis player Danielle Collins gestures to the fans at the Australian Open.Necessity and opportunity: Why Peter Dutton is targeting VictoriaRAnalysis by Richard WillinghamPhoto shows Peter Dutton scratches his head, dressed in a suit in front of a blue background.Kevin Rudd and Donald Trump have made direct contact, PM confirmsTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows A close up image of Kevin Rudd with his hand on his chin.

George Santos\\' sentencing delayed by judge until April 25 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDisgraced Rep. George Santos\\' sentencing delayed by judge until April 25\\n00:39\\n\\nNEW YORK --\\xa0Disgraced former Congressman George Santos had his February sentencing delayed until April 25, a judge ruled Wednesday.That will give Santos, 36, additional time to keep making new episodes of his podcast, \"Pants on Fire with George Santos,\" presumably so that he can pay the money he owes the government.Back in August, Santos\\xa0pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He owes $578,752.92 as per his plea deal, including $373,749.97 in restitution and $205,002.97 in forfeiture. He is expected to go to prison for at least two years when he is sentenced, although the judge previously said the estimated sentencing range was between 6-8 years.\\xa0In a letter to a judge last Friday, Santos\\' attorneys said their client is required to pay more than $200,000 in forfeiture money 30 days before he is sentenced. They said that, through his podcast, Santos \"now has a viable path to making meaningful progress in satisfying his obligations, requiring only additional time for the quarterly compensation structure to generate sufficient funds.\"\\xa0They asked the judge to delay his sentencing from Feb. 7 until a Friday in August, but the judge only moved it 10 weeks.\\n\\n\\nIn a statement, Santos\\' defense attorney Joseph Murray said, \"It\\'s unfortunate how unnecessarily difficult the government is making this process.\"Santos\\' attorneys said the podcast was initially meant to launch in September, but since it didn\\'t actually get off the ground until December, they wanted more time to record more episodes.\\xa0Delay sends a message that crime pays, prosecutors sayProsecutors had responded to the request for a delay in sentencing by saying Santos\\' claims of needing more time for the podcast to get off the ground were \"facially speculative, and, in any event, entirely insufficient to warrant such a lengthy adjournment.\"\\xa0\"His request for delay should be denied, and sentencing should proceed as scheduled,\" they wrote. \"A delay to allow Santos to develop his podcast -- the title of which is a tone-deaf and unrepentant reference to the crimes he committed -- is presumptively unreasonable.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nProsecutors also said Santos has already earned more than $400,000 from Cameo appearances and $400,000 for participating in a documentary. All of this is in addition to his $174,000 salary as a congressman. They took issue with a claim he made that he had less than $1,000 in liquid assets.\\xa0\"Allowing Santos to stave off sentencing specifically to monetize his infamy would send a message that crime pays,\" prosecutors wrote. \"Delaying sentencing to give him further time to grow his podcast listenership would enable Santos to further use his criminal prosecution for personal benefit.\"\"Justice delayed is justice denied\"Constituents in New York\\'s 3rd Congressional District formed an alliance two years ago to fight then-Rep. Santos, whose lies about his career and his past were unravelling before their eyes. They say their battle continues.\"It\\'s just egregious that someone like George Santos continues to try to rip off the public,\" said Sally Marzouk of the group Nassau Residents for Good Government.\"He\\'s such a national joke now that I think it\\'s worth reminding everyone he did real and tangible harm,\" said Kim Keiserman of Concerned Citizens NY-03.\"Santos was expelled in December in 2023. It has been well over a year since he\\'s been out of Congress. He belongs in prison. Why hasn\\'t he gone to prison? Justice delayed is justice denied,\" said Jody Kass Finkel, also of Concerned Citizens NY-03.\\n\\n\\nMore from CBS News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani reaches settlement over World Series rings, Florida condo\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Families in New York, New Jersey anxious about Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 90-year-old could lose Brooklyn home after deed theft scam, family says\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Suspected JFK stowaway pleads not guilty, held without bail\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 2 children in hurt in Bath Beach, Brooklyn apartment building fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn:\\n          United States Congress\\nNassau County\\nGeorge Santos\\nU.S. House of Representatives\\nLong Island\\n\\nJesse Zanger\\n\\n\\nJesse Zanger is the managing editor of CBSNewYork.com.

As part of his plea, he agreed to pay about $600,000 in forfeiture and restitution.MORE: George Santos seeks sentencing delay in federal fraud caseSantos said he needs an extra six months to come up with the money and asked the court to trust that his weekly podcast, \"Pants on Fire with George Santos,\" will eventually generate enough revenue to satisfy his obligations.Prosecutors called it \"extremely speculative\" for Santos to claim his financial circumstances will improve in the next six months.\"Santos\\'s claims are facially speculative and, in any event, entirely insufficient to warrant such a lengthy adjournment,\" prosecutors said. \"A delay to allow Santos to develop his podcast -- the title of which is a tone-deaf and unrepentant reference to the crimes he committed -- is presumptively unreasonable.\"MORE: \\'Right thing to do\\': George Santos addresses pleading guilty to federal chargesThey also questioned why he cannot pay when, they said, Santos generated substantial revenue streams through other means in the past year -- including $400,000 from his participation in a documentary and more than $400,000 from Cameo.\"The Court should have serious misgivings about postponing Santos\\'s sentencing based on his purported failure to save $578,752.94 after having previously claimed in the media to earn $80,000 per day capitalizing on his notoriety,\" prosecutors said.Related TopicsGeorge SantosPopular ReadsHere\\'s how to help wildfire victims as California blazes explode in sizeJan 16, 5:00 PMThis is how climate change contributed to the California wildfiresJan 8, 7:12 PMGiuliani must store Yankees rings ahead of defamation judgment trial, judge saysJan 14, 12:11 PMDaily deals starting at 40% off: Home, tech, fashion and beauty on sale nowJan 16, 1:08 PMTrump wants to rename the Gulf of Mexico.

Santos was just the sixth House member in the chamber’s history to be ousted by colleagues.\\n\\nHis earnings, prosecutors said, come on top of the roughly $174,000 taxpayer-funded salary he received during his 11-month stint on Capitol Hill.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    RELATED COVERAGE\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDisgraced former US Rep.

George Santos granted 3-month delay in sentencing for fraud and ID theft\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“His letter fails to provide any accounting of his current financial condition; fails to offer any explanation of his dissipation of assets (including personal spending) in the months since his guilty plea,” prosecutors wrote.Lawyers for Santos didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nElected in 2022, Santos was a once rising Republican star for flipping a wealthy New York district covering parts of Queens and Long Island.But his life story unraveled even before taking office, with his claims of a career at top Wall Street firms and having a college degree debunked amid questions about how he funded his campaign.In August, he pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, admitting that he duped voters, deceived donors and stole the identities of nearly a dozen people, including his own family members, to make donations to his campaign.\\n\\nAt the time, Santos blamed ambition for clouding his judgment and said he was “flooded with deep regret.” He faces a mandatory minimum two-year sentence for the identity theft charge and a maximum of 22 years in prison. As part of a deal negotiated with prosecutors, Santos agreed to pay nearly $580,000 in fines, including nearly $375,000 in restitution and $205,000 in forfeiture. But on Friday, his lawyers asked the judge to postpone the sentencing until August, noting he’s required to pay the forfeiture 30 days before his court date.They said the weekly podcast he announced shortly after pleading guilty represents a “promising revenue stream,” but, due to “technical and logistical impediments,” wasn’t launched until Dec. 15.“Mr. Santos now has a viable path to making meaningful progress in satisfying his obligations, requiring only additional time for the quarterly compensation structure to generate sufficient funds,” his lawyers wrote. Prosecutors however, countered that Santos’ request provides no details about the venture’s predicted financial returns.\\n\\nThey said his compensation, based on a report from the probation department, will likely consist of 50% of net profits, to be paid within 90 days of the end of each calendar quarter — an arrangement that’s “highly unlikely to net Santos enough money to satisfy his restitution and forfeiture obligations by August.”Prosecutors also cautioned that granting the delay would “create a perverse incentive structure,” in which defendants who capitalized on their “notoriety and criminality” were rewarded. “Put differently, allowing Santos to stave off sentencing specifically to monetize his infamy would send a message to the public that crime pays,” they wrote. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPHILIP MARCELO\\n\\n\\n                Marcelo is a general assignment reporter in the NYC bureau.

She denies all allegations against her. Advertisement \\nIn 1979, dos Santos’s father became the second president of the oil-rich country, which had been a Portuguese colony until 1975.\\nBefore that, dos Santos senior played an important role in Angola’s freedom struggle as a member of the People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the party that emerged as the ruling force after independence.\\nHe led the country for 38 years until stepping down in 2017 against a backdrop of mounting political pressure and public frustration over widespread corruption, poverty, and nepotism in government ranks.\\nIn 2022, he passed away, aged 79, in Barcelona, Spain, where he had been living and receiving medical treatment since leaving office.\\nDuring his tenure, his daughter became a prominent figure on Angola’s business landscape. Forbes declared her Africa’s first female billionaire in 2013 and, in 2016, she was appointed chair of Angola’s state oil company, Sonangol, but was dismissed in November the following year.\\nWhy is Isabel dos Santos such a controversial figure?\\nDos Santos was born in 1973 in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, where her father was studying and where he met her Russian mother, Tatiana Kukanova.\\nShe studied at private schools in the UK while Angola was embroiled in a civil war, which began immediately after independence and lasted for nearly 27 years, making it one of Africa’s longest and most devastating conflicts. She later earned a degree in electrical engineering from King’s College London before launching her business empire. Advertisement \\nIn 2020, the Luanda Leaks – some 700,000 documents detailing how the dos Santos family fortune was built using Angolan public money, which had been siphoned off into offshore accounts – were released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).\\nPortuguese hacker Rui Pinto later claimed responsibility for the Luanda Leaks, saying he had handed over a hard drive “containing all data related to the recent revelations concerning Ms Isabel dos Santos’s fortune”.\\nWhile the exact number of companies dos Santos holds or has held stakes in remains unclear, the Luanda Leaks revealed a vast network of 400 companies and subsidiaries linked to her in Angola, Portugal and various offshore locations. The significant ones include:\\n\\nOwnership of Vidatel, a holding company registered in the British Virgin Islands\\nVidatel’s 25 percent stake in Unitel, Angola’s leading mobile phone company which she co-founded in 1998\\nMajor stakes in ZAP, a satellite TV operator in Angola and Portugal\\nExtensive stakes in Angolan and Portuguese companies across multiple sectors, including telecoms, banking, energy, and construction\\n\\nDos Santos is widowed and has three children, details about whom are largely kept private.\\nHer late husband, Sindika Dokolo, died in 2020, in a diving accident near Dubai. A Congolese businessman and art collector, Dokolo was known for his efforts to reclaim African art looted during colonial times.\\nHis legacy, however, also intersected with dos Santos’s controversial business empire. The ICIJ’s Luanda Leaks revealed that Dokolo was closely tied to dos Santos’s business dealings, with partnerships built using Angolan state resources. Advertisement \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\nWhere is dos Santos now?\\nDos Santos currently lives in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, from where she regularly posts about her life on social media.\\nIn the past, she has also spent time in Portugal and the UK, both of which have played significant roles in her business dealings.\\nHowever, increasing international scrutiny, including an Interpol red notice issued in 2022 at Angola’s request, has restricted her movements, as it risks her detention and extradition if she enters a cooperating country.\\nWhy has the UK imposed sanctions on her?\\nIn November, Foreign Secretary Lammy announced sanctions on dos Santos as part of a crackdown on “dirty money” and kleptocracy – a form of government in which leaders exploit their power to steal public resources for personal gain.\\nA UK government statement issued last month said dos Santos had “systematically abused her positions at state-run companies to embezzle at least £350m [$442m], depriving Angola of resources and funding for much-needed development”.\\nThis week, she told the BBC that UK sanctions resulting from this had “surprised” her as she had not been found guilty of “any corruption in any court in any country”.\\nThe UK measures, launched under the country’s Global Anti-Corruption Sanctions Regulations, include a travel ban and the freezing of her UK assets.\\nPreviously, in 2023, the UK’s High Court froze 580 million pounds ($736m) of dos Santos’s assets after Unitel accused her of not paying debts and diverting improper loans to her Dutch company, Unitel International Holdings (UIH). Unitel was able to file a lawsuit in the UK because the allegedly misdirected transactions were linked to British financial systems and businesses. Advertisement \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\nHave other countries sanctioned her?\\nYes.\\nUnited States\\nIn 2021, the US also sanctioned her using anticorruption laws, barring her from entering the country and accusing her of “significant corruption”.\\nAngola\\nAngolan authorities froze her assets in the country in late 2019 for allegedly “steering” state funds to companies in which she held stakes during her father’s presidency, including state-run oil giant Sonangol. In January 2020, Angolan authorities named dos Santos as a formal suspect over alleged mismanagement and misappropriation of funds while she was chairwoman of Sonangol.\\nAttorney General Helder Pitta Groz told a news conference in the capital, Luanda, that dos Santos had not directly shown any interest in collaborating with Angolan authorities.\\nIn 2022, the Supreme Court ordered the “preventive” seizure of assets worth about $1bn held by dos Santos after authorities said they had evidence of alleged embezzlement and money laundering.\\nEarlier this year, Angola’s prosecutors charged dos Santos with 12 crimes, accusing her of defrauding the country of $219m while she was head of Sonangol.\\nPortugal\\nShortly after the Luanda Leaks, Portugal froze her assets estimated at 500 million euros (approximately $550m).\\nCombined, the asset freezes in Angola and Portugal total more than $1.5bn.\\nHave sanctions had an impact on dos Santos?\\nExperts believe they have.\\n“In the Angolan case, money has been recovered and elite rent-seeking is less brazen than it was during the tail end of the dos Santos era,” Alex Vines, director of the Africa programme at Chatham House in London, told Al Jazeera. Advertisement \\nHe added that meaningful and lasting anticorruption efforts are possible, even in regions with weak state systems, if there are “stronger and independent institutions, transparency, and peer and cultural pressure to dissuade endemic corruption”.\\nIn 2021, Forbes also removed dos Santos from its billionaire list. Once valuing her fortune at more than $2bn, Forbes explained that her frozen assets made it difficult to verify her net worth.\\nWhere else have allegations been made against her?\\nAngola, Portugal, the Netherlands and the UK have all investigated allegations of corruption, financial mismanagement and embezzlement made against dos Santos.\\nSince her dismissal as chair of Sonangol in 2017, dos Santos has characterised the allegations as part of a politically motivated campaign led by President Joao Lourenco’s administration to dismantle the influence of the dos Santos family.\\nDos Santos’s father had handpicked Lourenco, his former defence minister, to be his successor. Initially seen as a loyalist, Lourenco quickly distanced himself from the dos Santos family, launching an anticorruption campaign that targeted their wealth and influence.\\nIn 2019, Portuguese authorities also launched investigations into dos Santos’s investments, particularly in Efacec Power Solutions and Banco BIC, over concerns about funds linked to Angolan state resources. While there have been no convictions, the ongoing inquiries have restricted her financial operations in Portugal.\\nThe Luanda Leaks intensified public scrutiny in 2020 and broadened investigations into her business dealings. Advertisement \\nIn 2023, the Dutch Enterprise Chamber ruled that she illegally diverted 52 million euros from Sonangol into Exem Energy BV, a Netherlands-based company she co-owned with her late husband.\\nDos Santos insists she is willing to defend herself in court, but has never stood trial. In Angola, where dos Santos risks arrest upon return, she has cited concerns about political persecution and a lack of due process as reasons to not appear.\\nVines said dos Santos’s case “illustrates the vulnerability of elites that lose power or fall out of favour”.\\nWhich other high-profile figures have been slapped with sanctions in recent years?\\nThe UK sanctions announced last month also targeted Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash and Latvian politician Aivars Lembergs.\\nFirtash was accused of embezzling millions and hiding wealth and Lembergs of bribery and money laundering. Their family members are accused of holding or facilitating their assets.\\nBetween 2019 and 2021, Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, the son of Equatorial Guinea’s president, was sanctioned by the US, the UK and France for corruption and misappropriation of state funds, including spending on luxury items.\\nRussian oligarch and former Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK, the European Union and Canada in 2022 for his close ties to the Kremlin, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions targeted his vast wealth, including luxury properties and investments.\\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logo Sponsored Content  Advertisement AboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usStay ConnectedNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2025 Al Jazeera Media Network\\n\\n\"},\n",

A mix of tabloid writers, influencers and low-level Republican operatives had turned up there for a party he was throwing. It was ostensibly to toast the launch of his podcast, which carried the too-cute-by-half title of “Pants on Fire With George Santos.”You remember George Santos, right?It was at about this time last year when his short-lived career as a congressman from New York — a young, gay, Latino and Republican one at that — exploded spectacularly after he was exposed as a liar of epic, almost literary proportions. He lied about things big and small, stupid and serious. There were lies about money and employment and college degrees and dressing in drag. Lies about Jewish ancestry, Sept. 11, a gay nightclub shooting, a Broadway production of “Spider-Man” and a pet charity. He lied about volleyball.It was a truly great story, a farce about truth and shamelessness and the limits of partisan baboonery in American life and politics in (what was believed to be then) the post-Trump era. Newspaper editors assigned whole reporting teams to cover him and his deceptions. Big-shot magazine journalists and television anchors begged for interviews and access. The media frenzy reached such a pitch that Mr. Santos was compared, however ironically, to Princess Diana in many a viral meme (“Saturday Night Live” even made a joke about it). And then, at last, he was expelled from Congress. The fade to black happened fast, as it always does.And so there he was, one year later, in a tiny canteen near Times Square, just trying to get a little ink like old times.“I think the last time we saw an international media frenzy like that was Lady Di,” he said. “I’m not comparing myself to Princess Diana. I’m just saying the truth.” But, as Holly Golightly said, there are certain shades of limelight that can wreck a girl’s complexion. “Well, if you know how to walk out of the limelight in a way that you can capitalize on it,” he said, gesturing at an advertisement for his podcast that had been erected inside the bar.In August, Mr. Santos, 36, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft and owned up to all sorts of other schemes. “I allowed my ambition to cloud my judgment,” he told the judge that day. His sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 7, and most of his party guests on Monday said they expected he would soon be locked up, though for how long, nobody seemed sure (he faces a minimum of two years). Asked if he felt nervous about going to prison, he said: “Of course I’m nervous. It’s a big deal. I don’t want to go to prison. I have so much to look forward to, so it’s something that’s definitely stressful.”One of his very first friends in the news media was a journalist named Skye Ostreicher, who got to know him when she was covering local politics for City & State. She stood by the bar Monday and said she would definitely visit her buddy behind bars. “I told him I would bring him eyeliner or whatever beauty products he wants me to sneak in for him,” she said with a laugh.Also there was a young man who Mr. Santos introduced as his husband of three years. “My fictitional husband,” Mr. Santos said drolly. “Remember, nobody believed he existed?” He seemed to still be smarting over certain aspects of his coverage, able to recite specific sentences from year-old magazine articles about him that he did not appreciate at the time and does not appreciate now.There were at least three New York Post reporters there, as well as one writer named Zak Stone who had been sent by Butt magazine, a biannual gay publication printed on pink paper. Dressed in an oversize Balenciaga sweater and baggy black pants he said he had purchased in the Chinese city of Guangzhou, Mr. Stone looked a bit out of place among the disheveled tabloid crop. “I listened to the first podcast episode — it was OK,” he said. “I am curious how they’re going to keep going with it if he’s in jail.”Mr. Santos said he was mostly finished with politics — “so toxic” — and sees himself more as a cultural commentator. Yet he said he could not help but occasionally “dish” about the members of Congress he got to know from his short time on Capitol Hill. Representative Lauren Boebert, Republican of Colorado, remains his favorite. “She’s my bestie, for sure,” he said. One Republican representative he does not like is Nancy Mace of South Carolina, who has been battling against transgender activists lately. Mr. Santos has been flambéing her on X.“She’s unhinged,” he said. “I agree with her fight, I disagree with her antics. Her antics are of somebody who is manic compulsive.”A spokeswoman for Ms. Mace declined to comment.The congresswoman had recently said she was “physically accosted” by one activist who shook her hand so aggressively that she needed a brace for her wrist. But Mr. Santos wasn’t sure what to believe. “A lot of people are saying the sling is fake,” he said. “I’m not going to go and say that, because I don’t want to be sued, but I would really think she should shut the rumors down by just putting an X-ray out there. Show us the hairline fracture!”This seemed rather rich, considering Mr. Santos is still orchestrating stunts. Over the weekend, video footage of a man confronting him in Times Square and angrily flinging a milkshake at his face began to circulate on the internet. It kicked up an outrage and a serious-minded discourse about just how volatile our politics have become. But it turned out the whole thing was fake. As Mr. Santos revealed in a subsequent video, he had staged the encounter as part of a “promo campaign” to draw attention to his podcast. But then, he claimed, he decided against posting it and never meant for it to get out, but, somehow, a friend leaked it. Or something.At the bar, he said his dream podcast guest would be President-elect Donald J. Trump. But then he paused and thought for a moment. “All right, you know what, let me give you better than that,” he said. “I want to interview Gisele Bündchen.”A young man sat down at the piano and began to play “Linus and Lucy” from “A Charlie Brown Christmas” while Mr. Santos moved around the room, stopping to chat with each guest. It all vaguely had the air of a going-away party.Does he ever miss all the attention he once commanded? “It’s not that I liked the attention,” Mr. Santos said. “I understood the attention. And I tried to make the best I could out of it.”Shawn McCreesh is a Times reporter covering the 2024 presidential election.

The club received $6.91 million in bonus pool money this year.\\nInternational signing coverage:• Everything you need to know• Top 50 Prospects list• Each team's top international prospect• Latest news on Roki Sasaki\\nThe financial commitment to De Los Santos ranks among the highest that the organization has ever offered an international talent, and for good reason. The left-handed-hitting native of the Dominican Republic is highly regarded for his on-field instincts and passion for the game. One of the youngest members of this year’s international class, De Los Santos comes from a baseball family and trains with the highly regarded Jaime Ramos, a member of MLB’s Trainer Partnership Program.\\nDe Los Santos deploys a line drive-based approach, although his physique and twitchy actions leave the door open for some power to come into his game as he matures. He sees the majority of his game reps at shortstop, where he has solid actions and an above-average throwing arm. The tools are there for him to impact the game on the basepaths as well, with a plus run grade elevating his all-around ceiling.\\nThe Pirates have also signed Darell Morel, another Dominican shortstop, who landed a $1,778,600 bonus. At 6-foot-5, Morel boasts a powerful left-handed swing that allows him to tap into his extra-base pop with regularity. The organization has shown that its not afraid to keep taller players at the six, with 6-foot-7 Oneil Cruz sticking at the spot full-time during his ascent through Pittsburgh’s Minor League system.\\nThe Bucs also added Armstrong Muhoozi, an infielder from Uganda, for $40,000. Muhoozi is the second Ugandan player in the past three years to sign with Pittsburgh and just the fifth ever to sign with a Major League team (the Dodgers have signed three since 2022). Right-hander David Matoma, whom the Pirates signed in 2023, has posted a 0.47 ERA over 38 2/3 frames in the Minors.\\nWhile Pittsburgh lacks a true impact international talent at the upper levels of the Minors presently, the potential for one to emerge remains immense: their top 12 prospects were all Draft picks, but spots 13-30 include 10 players from the international market.\\n\\n Get Pirates tickets for the 2025 season\\n\\nBeyond the wealth of pitching talent currently in the Pirates’ pipeline, shortstop is the organization’s most robust position in terms of future impact. In the lower levels alone, the club boasts Konnor Griffin (PIT No. 2/MLB No. 50), Mitch Jebb (PIT No. 9), Wyatt Sanford (PIT No. 10), Yordany De Los Santos (Johan's older brother and PIT No. 13) and Keiner Delgado (PIT No. 23) as potential long-term options at the six.\\nBut shortstop is the position often held down by talented youngsters coming up the amateur ranks; in theory, if you can play there, you can play anywhere. Having a multitude of options is a luxury for any franchise, let alone one that determined last season that Cruz would go from full-time shortstop to full-time outfielder.\\nPaths to the big leagues are often long -- Cruz’s journey before becoming a full-time contributor for the Bucs was six years in the Minors in his own right. Johan De Los Santos, who will be 16 years old for most of the upcoming season, offers his own excitement ahead of his pro debut this summer, while Morel has already shown the flashes of impact potential that the club covets.\\nAn international player is eligible to sign with a Major League team between Jan. 15 and Dec. 15. He must turn 16 before he signs and be 17 before Sept. 1 the following year.\\nThat means players born between Sept. 1, 2007, and Aug. 31, 2008, will be eligible to sign in the current signing period. Players must be registered with Major League Baseball in advance to be eligible to sign.\\nAdditional notable Pirates signees and their signing bonuses:\\nGabriel Rodriguez, OF (Venezuela) -- $900,000Robinson Smith, RHP (Australia) -- $400,000Yoslaniel Hernandez, LHP (Cuba) -- $400,000\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}, {'title': 'The Many Leaning Towers Of Santos, Brazil', 'link': 'https://hackaday.com/2025/01/14/the-many-leaning-towers-of-santos-brazil/', 'snippet': \"If you've ever gazed at the shoreline of Santos, Brazil, and felt like something was tugging at your inner eye level, you're not alone.\", 'date': '2 days ago', 'position': 2, 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Many Leaning Towers Of Santos, Brazil | Hackaday\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkip to content\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHackaday\\n\\n\\nPrimary Menu\\n\\nHome\\nBlog\\nHackaday.io\\nTindie\\nHackaday Prize\\nSubmit\\nAbout\\n\\n\\nSearch for:\\n\\n\\n\\n January 16, 2025 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Many Leaning Towers Of Santos, Brazil\\n\\n\\n                48 Comments            \\n\\nby:\\nLewin Day\\n\\n\\n\\nJanuary 14, 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle:\\n\\n\\nCopy\\n\\nShort Link:\\n\\n\\nCopy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you’ve ever gazed at the shoreline of Santos, Brazil, and felt like something was tugging at your inner eye level, you’re not alone. In fact, you’ve spotted one of the world’s most bizarre architectural phenomena.\\nSantos is an interesting contradiction—it’s a sunny coastal city with pristine beaches that also plays host to a bustling port. What draws the eye, however, is the skyline—it’s decidedly askew. This isn’t a Photoshop job or some avant-garde urban planning experiment, either. It’s a consequence of engineering hubris, poor planning, and geology just doing its thing.\\n\\nSide to Side\\nIt’s easy to spot the lean on the buildings in Santos. Credit: janhamlet, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\\nThe Leaning Tower of Pisa is celebrated for being a building that somehow tilted over without collapsing. In Santos, though, that sort of thing barely raises an eyebrow. The city is dotted all over with buildings on the tilt. From 2004 to 2012, all 651 beachfront buildings were measured, and all were off-kilter to some degree. Some are just barely leaning over, maybe a couple of inches out of level. A more extreme example, like the Excelsior, measures 1.8 meters out of level. It’s a severe tilt that you can spot at an instant.\\nSantos didn’t set out to create its very own gallery of modern Leaning Towers. Most of the city’s lopsided skyscrapers were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, during a period when Brazil’s building codes were more permissive.\\nIt’s not just one building, either, it’s around 100 or so. Credit: janhamlet, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\\nDevelopers eager to cash in slapped together high-rise buildings with foundations only a few meters deep. This is perfectly valid when construction takes place directly on solid bedrock, but Santos sadly lacks such a convenient base. The ground is instead a bed of sand, seven meters deep, which sits upon a deeper bed of clay. Constructing the buildings with deep foundations down to the bedrock below would have avoided this problem, albeit at some expense. Instead, developers just pushed forward with the cheaper option.\\nFast forward a few decades, and the problems are obvious. Over time, the towers weight tended to push out water from the clay below, leading to the buildings sinking somewhat, and often quite unevenly. The result is a skyline that looks like it’s leaning with the wind, with around 100 buildings visibly off-kilter to the naked eye. It’s a unique sight—and a rare one at that. Where else will you see modern skyscrapers looking like they’re about to fall right over?\\nThe geology of Santos, combined with engineering decisions, lead to the problem. Credit: “Innovative techniques…”\\nDespite the lean, many of these buildings are still in use, most of them as residential housing. The buildings are regularly inspected and maintained, a sage decision given the ominous angles of lean. So far, there haven’t been any major catastrophies, so much as minor inconveniences. Problems with stuck doors and windows are common, and in many cases there’s an easily-detectable lean when walking around inside. Some owners choose to compensate by levelling their floor, though it’s usually still obvious there’s a problem whenever looking at the walls.\\nOver the years, there’s been talk of fixing the leaning buildings. Engineers have explored various means of jacking them back upright. Sadly, the cost of leveling even a single building is astronomical, and so far, only two have been corrected. Getting the buildings back into plumb involved huge hydraulic jacks, and the construction of new subfoundations able to properly support the building without further subsidence.\\xa0 This cost was, at the very least, offset to some degree by the fact the value of the apartments in the buildings rose significantly after correction. Still, for the rest of the buildings in Santos, though, it’s pretty much lean or bust.\\n          These two towers were the subject of extensive works to return them to plumb.were             Tower A was restored first, receiving a whole new foundation.          Tower B was fixed some years later.       \\nIt’s perhaps odd that Santos hasn’t become a global tourist trap like Pisa. Perhaps the answer lies in the scale of the leaning problem. Pisa’s single iconic tower is a historical oddity, a relic of medieval miscalculation. Santos’ slanting skyline, on the other hand, is a modern engineering mistake that doesn’t have the same romantic aura.\\xa0 Nor are the leaning building suitable as a tourist attraction, given the residents wouldn’t appreciate the intrusion of visitors marvelling at their wonky stairwells. Still, if you’re in the neighborhood, it’s worth a look. The beachfront is lined with these leaning giants, creating a surreal backdrop that’s equal parts charming and unsettling.\\nFor now, Santos’ leaning towers stand as a cautionary tale. Cutting corners in construction can leave a lasting mark—sometimes a very obvious one. Next time you’re marveling at a city’s skyline, spare a thought for the ground beneath it. You never know what secrets it’s hiding—or how much it’s shifting underfoot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPosted in Engineering, Featured, Interest, Original Art, SliderTagged brazil, building, engineering, santos \\n\\n\\nPost navigation\\n\\n←\\xa0It’s A Doughnut, In HardwareProcedurally Generated Terrain In OpenSCAD\\xa0→ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            48 thoughts on “The Many Leaning Towers Of Santos, Brazil”        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPaul McGuinness says: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJanuary 14, 2025 at 8:04 am\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot just Pisa… there are leaning towers in other Italian cities like Venice, Bologna and Rome.\\n\\n\\nReport comment \\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlake HANNAFORD says: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJanuary 14, 2025 at 12:29 pm\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPisa has more than one leaning tower.

Be it wildfires or hurricanes, everything was great until it wasnt. You played the odds that the worst wouldnt happen and in the end your fate was decided by mother nature and a crazed arsonist or errant electric component. Whats happening to the towers is inevitable and avoidable by anyone with common sense. Where youre right is that its still random chance how quickly the demise occurs.\\nOn another note, The Palisades was one of the most beautiful places to live on earth, with a luxurious climate. You can see it in the emotions of those reacting to the loss of their homes.

Every nation faces its own dilemmas, and often the solutions require more than just a simple change in policy or financial investment. The quest for a world free of structural failures or risks in different social spheres seems to be a universal and complex task. What we need to understand is that difficulties and structural flaws exist in every corner of the planet, and the key to a safer, more balanced future is to work together to find solutions, recognize our vulnerabilities, and learn from the mistakes of the past.\\n\\n\\nReport comment \\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDavid says: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJanuary 16, 2025 at 3:12 am\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis comment reads like AI\\nAlso as a Santos local I can tell you this only really exists here.\\n\\n\\nReport comment \\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a ReplyCancel reply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

Flowers\\n\\n\\nJan 14, 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJan 14, 2025\\n\\n\\n\\nChicago Bears\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe nightmare that was the 2024 Chicago Bears season is over. Before the transactional period starts and the roster changes begin, we will recap the seasons of most of the 53-man roster. Today, we’re looking at the 2024 season of kicker Cairo Santos.\\n\\n\\n\\nCairo Santos’ 2024 Snapshot\\n\\nWhat a roller coaster ride this season was for Cairo Santos. He experienced the highs of drilling a game-winning kick against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field and the lows of having his would-be game-winning kick blocked by the Packers at Soldier Field in November.\\nSantos said after the former that he prayed on receiving the opportunity to redeem his blocked kick against the Packers. As fate would have it, his prayers were answered, and he did not miss his shot at redemption. But was it enough to earn the confidence of the Bears front office moving forward?\\nSantos’ leg strength and distance were topics of conversation for much of the season. This was amplified when the Packers publicly admitted they felt they could block his kick at a specific range because of the trajectory Santos needed to get it off from that distance. \\n\\n\\n“On film, on his past games, we seen him how he was kicking it low, so we knew we had a good chance [of blocking].” Packers rookie linebacker Edgerrin Cooper said after the November 17 game at Soldier Field (via Kalyn Kahler). “We’ve been emphasizing it so much this week. Coach Rich, he even said he’ll be upset if we ain’t get one.”\\n\\n© Daniel Bartel-Imagn Images\\n\\nEarly in Santos’ career, he struggled mightily with converting field goal attempts over 50 yards. After a three-year run in Kansas City, where he served as the team’s starting kicker, his distance woes left him bouncing around the league for the next three years, making stops in Chicago, Los Angeles, Tampa Bay, and Tennessee before returning to Chicago as the Bears contingency plan for Eddie Piñeiro, who they had lost confidence in.\\nSince taking over for Piñeiro full-time in 2020, he’s been much better, making 21 of 27 from 50+ yards and 39 of 48 in the 40-49 yard range. Santos hasn’t missed a field goal from under 40 yards in his five seasons as the Bears full-time kicker, making his last 73 kicks from less than 40 yards.\\n\\n\\nBy the Numbers\\n\\nField Goals: 21-25\\nField Goal %: 84.0\\nField Goal 20-29: 4-4 (100%)\\nField Goal 30-39: 4-4 (100%)\\nField Goal 40-49: 5-8 (62.5%)\\nField Goal 50+: 8-9 (88.8%)\\nField Goal Long: 54\\nExtra Points: 25-26\\n\\n\\nContract Status \\nSantos signed a four-year, $15.6 million contract extension with the Bears in December 2023. In 2025, he is scheduled to make $3.1 million in base salary, $1.06 million in signing bonuses, and $100 thousand in workout bonuses. His total cap number for 2025 is $4.26 million. \\nIf the Bears decided to move on from Santos as a pre-June 1 cut designation, they would incur $2.18 million in dead cap money and save $2.64 million. If the Bears wanted to give Santos one more bite at the apple, it would be cheaper to cut him next offseason; at this point, they would incur a $1.12 million dead cap hit and receive $2.64 million in cap savings. \\n\\n\\nOne Big Question for 2025\\nIs Cairo Santos’ leg strong enough? \\nSantos’ percentage on kicks north of 50 yards was good in 2024, but the Bears know his limitations. His long was 54 yards, and his career-long is 55 yards. The Bears didn’t send him out for kicks that would have been outside that range multiple times, whereas kicks from 55+ yards have become commonplace around the NFL. \\n\\n© Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\\n\\nDallas’ Brandon Aubrey nailed a 65-yard field goal this season and was 2-4 on kicks longer than 60 yards. Joey Slye and Tyler Bass have makes from north of 60 this season, and 21 other kickers have season-long field goals of 56 yards or longer. \\nSantos was blocked three times this season, the most in the league. This is another sign that his trajectory when attempting deep kicks is too low in an attempt to compensate for having a lesser leg than most NFL kickers. \\n\\n\\nIs Santos’ limitations from distance a significant concern for the Bears this offseason? It’s probably not at the top of the list for Ryan Poles and this front office. Hiring a head coach, an entire staff of assistants, and multiple starting roles on the offensive and defensive lines are bigger priorities to fill in the next few months. Taking a kicker in the draft is probably not happening after they spent a fourth-rounder on a punter last April. It would come via free agency or the undrafted free agent route if they were to replace Santos.\\nBut my hunch is they’ll run it back with Santos and make a move following the 2025 season when it’s more financially prudent for them to do so. But if they don’t, here is a list of potential options:\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nShow comments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSHOW COMMENTS!\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead More\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCunningham and the Titans, Frazier and the Cowboys, New Analytics Director Needed, and Other Bears Bullets\\n\\n\\nHere is an Explanation For Why It’s Taking So Long For the Bears to Hire a Coach\\n\\n\\nThe 2024 Chicago Bears Offensive Line Grades Are Out —\\xa0And They’re Not Pretty\\n\\n\\nWhy Are the Bears So Hot For Mike McCarthy?\\n\\n\\nCaleb Williams Outlines EXACTLY What He Wants in the New Bears Head Coach\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwritten by\\n\\n              Patrick K.

(Supplied)DEMIRS prosecutor Jeremy Johnston said the section of the pipeline was nearing the end of its life and was close to five years old at the time.He said Santos failed to properly investigate the pipeline for any potential damage and that punishment was needed to deter other companies from similar negligence.Santos gave the court an endorsed guilty plea prior to Monday\\'s appearance and agreed the company had failed to adequately ensure the pipeline was safe for use.Gas giant Santos accused of cover-up over oil spill, dolphin deaths off WA coastPhoto shows A dolphin floating belly up on top of the ocean surface. A former Santos employee accuses\\xa0the oil and gas company of covering up the severity of an oil spill he alleges killed dolphins off WA\\'s coast.Santos\\'s lawyer Liam Nicholls told the court that the company had conducted its own internal investigation, commissioned an independent inquiry and continued to work directly with the regulator.He said the working life spans of pipelines were also amended, reducing them to three years, instead of five.Mr Nicholls told the court Santos \"takes its statutory obligations seriously\" and expressed remorse on behalf of the company.In his decision, Magistrate Young said any punishment needed to reflect the seriousness of the allegations.\"There can be no message conveyed that it is more effective to absorb fines as the cost of doing business,\" he said.However, he said the actions taken by Santos had given \"serious attention\" to the infringement and had set up a \"robust set of safeguards\".Magistrate Young noted that \\xa0\"no allegation of environmental damage\" was brought to the court\\'s attention and said the spill was \"relatively limited\".A dead dolphin allegedly found in the ocean after the oil spill. (Supplied: Parliament of Australia)\\'Limited\\' environmental impactLawyers for both the state and Santos told the court there was no serious environmental impact because of the spill.Mr Nicholls said aerial and water surveys revealed 95 per cent of the condensate evaporated within 24 hours of the spill and the remainder evaporated over the next few days.Whistleblower testimony tabled in federal parliament in early 2023 claimed the spill caused the deaths of dolphins and other marine life.The testimony, tabled by independent Senator David Pocock, also claimed Santos had covered up the impact of the spill.Santos has continually denied the claims and a report at the time found the environmental impact to be \"negligible\".In a statement provided to the ABC, a Santos spokesperson said the company \"deeply regrets the spill\" and that previous surveys on the line revealed \"no damage or deterioration\".The spokesperson confirmed the line had been \"maintained in accordance with the prescribed service life of the line\".DEMIRS resource and environmental compliance executive director Tyler Sujdovic said enforcing compliance was a key priority of the department.\"Operating subsea pipelines in a \\'proper and workmanlike manner\\' is a fundamental principle widely understood and applied by operators in the oil and gas industry,\" he said.\"Companies must ensure all workers, including contractors, have the required training and access to up-to-date written procedures to manage petroleum effectively.\"Mr Sudjovic said the department would continue to ensure petroleum activities were undertaken in a safe way.Fine \\'completely inadequate\\'The Conservation Council of WA has labelled the fine as \"inadequate\" and warned it would do little to prevent further cases.The council\\'s fossil fuels programs manager Anna Champan said the costs would not be \"enough to deter oil spill\".\"That\\'s less than 40 cents per litre of oil spilled,\" she said.\"So the fine is completely inadequate.\"Find more local newsBrowse for your location and find more local ABC News and informationPosted\\xa0Mon 6 Jan 2025 at 6:38amMonday 6 Jan 2025 at 6:38amMon 6 Jan 2025 at 6:38am, updated\\xa0Tue 7 Jan 2025 at 1:13amTuesday 7 Jan 2025 at 1:13amTue 7 Jan 2025 at 1:13amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX\\xa0(formerly\\xa0Twitter)Top StoriesCeasefire back on track as Israel says it\\'s reached deal with HamasLIVEPhoto shows picture of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\\'We will hunt you down\\': Police vow to find those behind racist attackTopic:VandalismPhoto shows Silver Mercedes Benz vandalised with an antisemitic message in the early hours of the morning\\'Brutal\\' Australian Open fans under fire again after Collins\\'s post-match anticsLIVEPhoto shows Tennis player Danielle Collins gestures to the fans at the Australian Open.Necessity and opportunity: Why Peter Dutton is targeting VictoriaRAnalysis by Richard WillinghamPhoto shows Peter Dutton scratches his head, dressed in a suit in front of a blue background.Kevin Rudd and Donald Trump have made direct contact, PM confirmsTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows A close up image of Kevin Rudd with his hand on his chin.

He owes $578,752.92 as per his plea deal, including $373,749.97 in restitution and $205,002.97 in forfeiture. He is expected to go to prison for at least two years when he is sentenced, although the judge previously said the estimated sentencing range was between 6-8 years.\\xa0In a letter to a judge last Friday, Santos\\' attorneys said their client is required to pay more than $200,000 in forfeiture money 30 days before he is sentenced. They said that, through his podcast, Santos \"now has a viable path to making meaningful progress in satisfying his obligations, requiring only additional time for the quarterly compensation structure to generate sufficient funds.\"\\xa0They asked the judge to delay his sentencing from Feb. 7 until a Friday in August, but the judge only moved it 10 weeks.\\n\\n\\nIn a statement, Santos\\' defense attorney Joseph Murray said, \"It\\'s unfortunate how unnecessarily difficult the government is making this process.\"Santos\\' attorneys said the podcast was initially meant to launch in September, but since it didn\\'t actually get off the ground until December, they wanted more time to record more episodes.\\xa0Delay sends a message that crime pays, prosecutors sayProsecutors had responded to the request for a delay in sentencing by saying Santos\\' claims of needing more time for the podcast to get off the ground were \"facially speculative, and, in any event, entirely insufficient to warrant such a lengthy adjournment.\"\\xa0\"His request for delay should be denied, and sentencing should proceed as scheduled,\" they wrote. \"A delay to allow Santos to develop his podcast -- the title of which is a tone-deaf and unrepentant reference to the crimes he committed -- is presumptively unreasonable.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nProsecutors also said Santos has already earned more than $400,000 from Cameo appearances and $400,000 for participating in a documentary. All of this is in addition to his $174,000 salary as a congressman. They took issue with a claim he made that he had less than $1,000 in liquid assets.\\xa0\"Allowing Santos to stave off sentencing specifically to monetize his infamy would send a message that crime pays,\" prosecutors wrote. \"Delaying sentencing to give him further time to grow his podcast listenership would enable Santos to further use his criminal prosecution for personal benefit.\"\"Justice delayed is justice denied\"Constituents in New York\\'s 3rd Congressional District formed an alliance two years ago to fight then-Rep. Santos, whose lies about his career and his past were unravelling before their eyes. They say their battle continues.\"It\\'s just egregious that someone like George Santos continues to try to rip off the public,\" said Sally Marzouk of the group Nassau Residents for Good Government.\"He\\'s such a national joke now that I think it\\'s worth reminding everyone he did real and tangible harm,\" said Kim Keiserman of Concerned Citizens NY-03.\"Santos was expelled in December in 2023. It has been well over a year since he\\'s been out of Congress. He belongs in prison. Why hasn\\'t he gone to prison? Justice delayed is justice denied,\" said Jody Kass Finkel, also of Concerned Citizens NY-03.\\n\\n\\nMore from CBS News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani reaches settlement over World Series rings, Florida condo\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Families in New York, New Jersey anxious about Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 90-year-old could lose Brooklyn home after deed theft scam, family says\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Suspected JFK stowaway pleads not guilty, held without bail\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 2 children in hurt in Bath Beach, Brooklyn apartment building fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn:\\n          United States Congress\\nNassau County\\nGeorge Santos\\nU.S. House of Representatives\\nLong Island\\n\\nJesse Zanger\\n\\n\\nJesse Zanger is the managing editor of CBSNewYork.com.

Santos was just the sixth House member in the chamber’s history to be ousted by colleagues.\\n\\nHis earnings, prosecutors said, come on top of the roughly $174,000 taxpayer-funded salary he received during his 11-month stint on Capitol Hill.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    RELATED COVERAGE\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDisgraced former US Rep. George Santos granted 3-month delay in sentencing for fraud and ID theft\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDisgraced former US Rep. George Santos granted 3-month delay in sentencing for fraud and ID theft\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“His letter fails to provide any accounting of his current financial condition; fails to offer any explanation of his dissipation of assets (including personal spending) in the months since his guilty plea,” prosecutors wrote.Lawyers for Santos didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nElected in 2022, Santos was a once rising Republican star for flipping a wealthy New York district covering parts of Queens and Long Island.But his life story unraveled even before taking office, with his claims of a career at top Wall Street firms and having a college degree debunked amid questions about how he funded his campaign.In August, he pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, admitting that he duped voters, deceived donors and stole the identities of nearly a dozen people, including his own family members, to make donations to his campaign.\\n\\nAt the time, Santos blamed ambition for clouding his judgment and said he was “flooded with deep regret.” He faces a mandatory minimum two-year sentence for the identity theft charge and a maximum of 22 years in prison. As part of a deal negotiated with prosecutors, Santos agreed to pay nearly $580,000 in fines, including nearly $375,000 in restitution and $205,000 in forfeiture. But on Friday, his lawyers asked the judge to postpone the sentencing until August, noting he’s required to pay the forfeiture 30 days before his court date.They said the weekly podcast he announced shortly after pleading guilty represents a “promising revenue stream,” but, due to “technical and logistical impediments,” wasn’t launched until Dec. 15.“Mr. Santos now has a viable path to making meaningful progress in satisfying his obligations, requiring only additional time for the quarterly compensation structure to generate sufficient funds,” his lawyers wrote. Prosecutors however, countered that Santos’ request provides no details about the venture’s predicted financial returns.\\n\\nThey said his compensation, based on a report from the probation department, will likely consist of 50% of net profits, to be paid within 90 days of the end of each calendar quarter — an arrangement that’s “highly unlikely to net Santos enough money to satisfy his restitution and forfeiture obligations by August.”Prosecutors also cautioned that granting the delay would “create a perverse incentive structure,” in which defendants who capitalized on their “notoriety and criminality” were rewarded. “Put differently, allowing Santos to stave off sentencing specifically to monetize his infamy would send a message to the public that crime pays,” they wrote. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPHILIP MARCELO\\n\\n\\n                Marcelo is a general assignment reporter in the NYC bureau.

She denies all allegations against her. Advertisement \\nIn 1979, dos Santos’s father became the second president of the oil-rich country, which had been a Portuguese colony until 1975.\\nBefore that, dos Santos senior played an important role in Angola’s freedom struggle as a member of the People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the party that emerged as the ruling force after independence.\\nHe led the country for 38 years until stepping down in 2017 against a backdrop of mounting political pressure and public frustration over widespread corruption, poverty, and nepotism in government ranks.\\nIn 2022, he passed away, aged 79, in Barcelona, Spain, where he had been living and receiving medical treatment since leaving office.\\nDuring his tenure, his daughter became a prominent figure on Angola’s business landscape. Forbes declared her Africa’s first female billionaire in 2013 and, in 2016, she was appointed chair of Angola’s state oil company, Sonangol, but was dismissed in November the following year.\\nWhy is Isabel dos Santos such a controversial figure?\\nDos Santos was born in 1973 in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, where her father was studying and where he met her Russian mother, Tatiana Kukanova.\\nShe studied at private schools in the UK while Angola was embroiled in a civil war, which began immediately after independence and lasted for nearly 27 years, making it one of Africa’s longest and most devastating conflicts. She later earned a degree in electrical engineering from King’s College London before launching her business empire. Advertisement \\nIn 2020, the Luanda Leaks – some 700,000 documents detailing how the dos Santos family fortune was built using Angolan public money, which had been siphoned off into offshore accounts – were released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).\\nPortuguese hacker Rui Pinto later claimed responsibility for the Luanda Leaks, saying he had handed over a hard drive “containing all data related to the recent revelations concerning Ms Isabel dos Santos’s fortune”.\\nWhile the exact number of companies dos Santos holds or has held stakes in remains unclear, the Luanda Leaks revealed a vast network of 400 companies and subsidiaries linked to her in Angola, Portugal and various offshore locations. The significant ones include:\\n\\nOwnership of Vidatel, a holding company registered in the British Virgin Islands\\nVidatel’s 25 percent stake in Unitel, Angola’s leading mobile phone company which she co-founded in 1998\\nMajor stakes in ZAP, a satellite TV operator in Angola and Portugal\\nExtensive stakes in Angolan and Portuguese companies across multiple sectors, including telecoms, banking, energy, and construction\\n\\nDos Santos is widowed and has three children, details about whom are largely kept private.\\nHer late husband, Sindika Dokolo, died in 2020, in a diving accident near Dubai. A Congolese businessman and art collector, Dokolo was known for his efforts to reclaim African art looted during colonial times.\\nHis legacy, however, also intersected with dos Santos’s controversial business empire. The ICIJ’s Luanda Leaks revealed that Dokolo was closely tied to dos Santos’s business dealings, with partnerships built using Angolan state resources. Advertisement \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\nWhere is dos Santos now?\\nDos Santos currently lives in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, from where she regularly posts about her life on social media.\\nIn the past, she has also spent time in Portugal and the UK, both of which have played significant roles in her business dealings.\\nHowever, increasing international scrutiny, including an Interpol red notice issued in 2022 at Angola’s request, has restricted her movements, as it risks her detention and extradition if she enters a cooperating country.\\nWhy has the UK imposed sanctions on her?\\nIn November, Foreign Secretary Lammy announced sanctions on dos Santos as part of a crackdown on “dirty money” and kleptocracy – a form of government in which leaders exploit their power to steal public resources for personal gain.\\nA UK government statement issued last month said dos Santos had “systematically abused her positions at state-run companies to embezzle at least £350m [$442m], depriving Angola of resources and funding for much-needed development”.\\nThis week, she told the BBC that UK sanctions resulting from this had “surprised” her as she had not been found guilty of “any corruption in any court in any country”.\\nThe UK measures, launched under the country’s Global Anti-Corruption Sanctions Regulations, include a travel ban and the freezing of her UK assets.\\nPreviously, in 2023, the UK’s High Court froze 580 million pounds ($736m) of dos Santos’s assets after Unitel accused her of not paying debts and diverting improper loans to her Dutch company, Unitel International Holdings (UIH). Unitel was able to file a lawsuit in the UK because the allegedly misdirected transactions were linked to British financial systems and businesses. Advertisement \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\nHave other countries sanctioned her?\\nYes.\\nUnited States\\nIn 2021, the US also sanctioned her using anticorruption laws, barring her from entering the country and accusing her of “significant corruption”.\\nAngola\\nAngolan authorities froze her assets in the country in late 2019 for allegedly “steering” state funds to companies in which she held stakes during her father’s presidency, including state-run oil giant Sonangol. In January 2020, Angolan authorities named dos Santos as a formal suspect over alleged mismanagement and misappropriation of funds while she was chairwoman of Sonangol.\\nAttorney General Helder Pitta Groz told a news conference in the capital, Luanda, that dos Santos had not directly shown any interest in collaborating with Angolan authorities.\\nIn 2022, the Supreme Court ordered the “preventive” seizure of assets worth about $1bn held by dos Santos after authorities said they had evidence of alleged embezzlement and money laundering.\\nEarlier this year, Angola’s prosecutors charged dos Santos with 12 crimes, accusing her of defrauding the country of $219m while she was head of Sonangol.\\nPortugal\\nShortly after the Luanda Leaks, Portugal froze her assets estimated at 500 million euros (approximately $550m).\\nCombined, the asset freezes in Angola and Portugal total more than $1.5bn.\\nHave sanctions had an impact on dos Santos?\\nExperts believe they have.\\n“In the Angolan case, money has been recovered and elite rent-seeking is less brazen than it was during the tail end of the dos Santos era,” Alex Vines, director of the Africa programme at Chatham House in London, told Al Jazeera. Advertisement \\nHe added that meaningful and lasting anticorruption efforts are possible, even in regions with weak state systems, if there are “stronger and independent institutions, transparency, and peer and cultural pressure to dissuade endemic corruption”.\\nIn 2021, Forbes also removed dos Santos from its billionaire list. Once valuing her fortune at more than $2bn, Forbes explained that her frozen assets made it difficult to verify her net worth.\\nWhere else have allegations been made against her?\\nAngola, Portugal, the Netherlands and the UK have all investigated allegations of corruption, financial mismanagement and embezzlement made against dos Santos.\\nSince her dismissal as chair of Sonangol in 2017, dos Santos has characterised the allegations as part of a politically motivated campaign led by President Joao Lourenco’s administration to dismantle the influence of the dos Santos family.\\nDos Santos’s father had handpicked Lourenco, his former defence minister, to be his successor. Initially seen as a loyalist, Lourenco quickly distanced himself from the dos Santos family, launching an anticorruption campaign that targeted their wealth and influence.\\nIn 2019, Portuguese authorities also launched investigations into dos Santos’s investments, particularly in Efacec Power Solutions and Banco BIC, over concerns about funds linked to Angolan state resources. While there have been no convictions, the ongoing inquiries have restricted her financial operations in Portugal.\\nThe Luanda Leaks intensified public scrutiny in 2020 and broadened investigations into her business dealings. Advertisement \\nIn 2023, the Dutch Enterprise Chamber ruled that she illegally diverted 52 million euros from Sonangol into Exem Energy BV, a Netherlands-based company she co-owned with her late husband.\\nDos Santos insists she is willing to defend herself in court, but has never stood trial. In Angola, where dos Santos risks arrest upon return, she has cited concerns about political persecution and a lack of due process as reasons to not appear.\\nVines said dos Santos’s case “illustrates the vulnerability of elites that lose power or fall out of favour”.\\nWhich other high-profile figures have been slapped with sanctions in recent years?\\nThe UK sanctions announced last month also targeted Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash and Latvian politician Aivars Lembergs.\\nFirtash was accused of embezzling millions and hiding wealth and Lembergs of bribery and money laundering. Their family members are accused of holding or facilitating their assets.\\nBetween 2019 and 2021, Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, the son of Equatorial Guinea’s president, was sanctioned by the US, the UK and France for corruption and misappropriation of state funds, including spending on luxury items.\\nRussian oligarch and former Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK, the European Union and Canada in 2022 for his close ties to the Kremlin, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions targeted his vast wealth, including luxury properties and investments.\\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logo Sponsored Content  Advertisement AboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usStay ConnectedNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2025 Al Jazeera Media Network\\n\\n\"}, {'title': '‘We’ll have to see’ – Championship star confirms shock January transfer bid from Pele’s former club Santos...', 'link': 'https://talksport.com/football/2441474/josh-windass-santos-transfer-news-sheffield-wednesday/', 'snippet': 'Josh Windass could be set to swap Sheffield Wednesday for Santos in a sensational January transfer, talkSPORT understands.', 'date': '1 week ago', 'position': 9, 'content': '\\'We\\'ll have to see\\' -

A mix of tabloid writers, influencers and low-level Republican operatives had turned up there for a party he was throwing. It was ostensibly to toast the launch of his podcast, which carried the too-cute-by-half title of “Pants on Fire With George Santos.”You remember George Santos, right?It was at about this time last year when his short-lived career as a congressman from New York — a young, gay, Latino and Republican one at that — exploded spectacularly after he was exposed as a liar of epic, almost literary proportions. He lied about things big and small, stupid and serious. There were lies about money and employment and college degrees and dressing in drag. Lies about Jewish ancestry, Sept. 11, a gay nightclub shooting, a Broadway production of “Spider-Man” and a pet charity. He lied about volleyball.It was a truly great story, a farce about truth and shamelessness and the limits of partisan baboonery in American life and politics in (what was believed to be then) the post-Trump era. Newspaper editors assigned whole reporting teams to cover him and his deceptions. Big-shot magazine journalists and television anchors begged for interviews and access. The media frenzy reached such a pitch that Mr. Santos was compared, however ironically, to Princess Diana in many a viral meme (“Saturday Night Live” even made a joke about it). And then, at last, he was expelled from Congress. The fade to black happened fast, as it always does.And so there he was, one year later, in a tiny canteen near Times Square, just trying to get a little ink like old times.“I think the last time we saw an international media frenzy like that was Lady Di,” he said. “I’m not comparing myself to Princess Diana. I’m just saying the truth.” But, as Holly Golightly said, there are certain shades of limelight that can wreck a girl’s complexion. “Well, if you know how to walk out of the limelight in a way that you can capitalize on it,” he said, gesturing at an advertisement for his podcast that had been erected inside the bar.In August, Mr. Santos, 36, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft and owned up to all sorts of other schemes. “I allowed my ambition to cloud my judgment,” he told the judge that day. His sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 7, and most of his party guests on Monday said they expected he would soon be locked up, though for how long, nobody seemed sure (he faces a minimum of two years). Asked if he felt nervous about going to prison, he said: “Of course I’m nervous. It’s a big deal. I don’t want to go to prison. I have so much to look forward to, so it’s something that’s definitely stressful.”One of his very first friends in the news media was a journalist named Skye Ostreicher, who got to know him when she was covering local politics for City & State. She stood by the bar Monday and said she would definitely visit her buddy behind bars. “I told him I would bring him eyeliner or whatever beauty products he wants me to sneak in for him,” she said with a laugh.Also there was a young man who Mr. Santos introduced as his husband of three years. “My fictitional husband,” Mr. Santos said drolly. “Remember, nobody believed he existed?” He seemed to still be smarting over certain aspects of his coverage, able to recite specific sentences from year-old magazine articles about him that he did not appreciate at the time and does not appreciate now.There were at least three New York Post reporters there, as well as one writer named Zak Stone who had been sent by Butt magazine, a biannual gay publication printed on pink paper. Dressed in an oversize Balenciaga sweater and baggy black pants he said he had purchased in the Chinese city of Guangzhou, Mr. Stone looked a bit out of place among the disheveled tabloid crop. “I listened to the first podcast episode — it was OK,” he said. “I am curious how they’re going to keep going with it if he’s in jail.”Mr. Santos said he was mostly finished with politics — “so toxic” — and sees himself more as a cultural commentator. Yet he said he could not help but occasionally “dish” about the members of Congress he got to know from his short time on Capitol Hill. Representative Lauren Boebert, Republican of Colorado, remains his favorite. “She’s my bestie, for sure,” he said. One Republican representative he does not like is Nancy Mace of South Carolina, who has been battling against transgender activists lately. Mr. Santos has been flambéing her on X.“She’s unhinged,” he said. “I agree with her fight, I disagree with her antics. Her antics are of somebody who is manic compulsive.”A spokeswoman for Ms. Mace declined to comment.The congresswoman had recently said she was “physically accosted” by one activist who shook her hand so aggressively that she needed a brace for her wrist. But Mr. Santos wasn’t sure what to believe. “A lot of people are saying the sling is fake,” he said. “I’m not going to go and say that, because I don’t want to be sued, but I would really think she should shut the rumors down by just putting an X-ray out there. Show us the hairline fracture!”This seemed rather rich, considering Mr. Santos is still orchestrating stunts. Over the weekend, video footage of a man confronting him in Times Square and angrily flinging a milkshake at his face began to circulate on the internet. It kicked up an outrage and a serious-minded discourse about just how volatile our politics have become. But it turned out the whole thing was fake. As Mr. Santos revealed in a subsequent video, he had staged the encounter as part of a “promo campaign” to draw attention to his podcast. But then, he claimed, he decided against posting it and never meant for it to get out, but, somehow, a friend leaked it. Or something.At the bar, he said his dream podcast guest would be President-elect Donald J. Trump. But then he paused and thought for a moment. “All right, you know what, let me give you better than that,” he said. “I want to interview Gisele Bündchen.”A young man sat down at the piano and began to play “Linus and Lucy” from “A Charlie Brown Christmas” while Mr. Santos moved around the room, stopping to chat with each guest. It all vaguely had the air of a going-away party.Does he ever miss all the attention he once commanded? “It’s not that I liked the attention,” Mr. Santos said. “I understood the attention. And I tried to make the best I could out of it.”Shawn McCreesh is a Times reporter covering the 2024 presidential election.
